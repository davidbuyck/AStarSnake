# AStarSnake
I used artificial intelligence to solve the game of snake in optimal time using a predictive, dynamic A* search


In this project I examined various shortest path algorithms to develop my own artificial intelligence program to solve 
the Nokia Snake game in optimal time.

# Scripts

AStarSnake.cs uses the PredictiveDynamicAStar.cs script that uses a modified AStar search algorithm.
HamiltonianSnake.cs uses Hamiltonian Path.cs to solve the snake game in a simple Hamiltonian cycle.

# Papers

The Predictive Dynamic Shortest Path Algorithms pdf contains the process and results of my development and research of 
programs as well as the other research documents that inspired the project.
